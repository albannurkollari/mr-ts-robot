# mr-ts-robot

A `TypeScript` application that simulates a robot navigating in a two-dimensional space.  
It interprets movement commands in both `Swedish` and `English`, tracks the robot’s position and direction,  
and reports the final outcome. `pnpm` is the default choice for installing packages but you may choose any other package manager for that matter, without a hassle.

The project’s primary purpose is to demonstrate:

- Clean `TypeScript` code structure
- Good design principles
- Automated test coverage

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Run tests
npm test
```
